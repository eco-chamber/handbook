## Mentoring Groups

Mentoring is a professional development opportunity that the Carpentries offers our growing instructor pool to help community members learn and grow.

Mentoring Groups support instructors in a variety of ways. Whether you are a new instructor preparing to teach your first workshop, a seasoned instructor hoping to launch workshops in a new community, or an instructor excited about getting involved with lesson development and maintenance, mentoring groups will help you gain the confidence, technical skills, and teaching skills you need to reach your goal. 

Mentors guide small groups of no more than five mentees toward a particular outcome. Outcomes might be anything from teaching a specific lesson (i.e. Version Control with Git) to making a meaningful contribution to one of our lessons.

### Mentoring Groups Highlights  

We are offering curriculum-specific mentoring this time around. Both mentors and mentees can choose which tools they are most interested in from the following list:
+ Git  
+ Shell  
+ Python  
+ R  
+ SQL

Once a topic has been picked, participants can choose the type of mentoring they want for their chosen tool:
+ Lesson Maintenance  
  - Contributing to current lesson development  
  - Contributing to lesson maintenance  
+ Teaching Workshops  
  - Developing confidence and skill in teaching  
  - Preparing to teach a specific lesson (i.e. Python)  

We will also offer mentoring that is more general in nature. For those who would like to develop greater skill in community building, either of these mentoring opportunities might suit:
+ Organizing Workshops   
  - Logistics of organizing a workshop (e.g. marketing, registration)  
  - Logistics of running a workshop (e.g. recruiting instructors, distributing tasks)  
+ Community Building  
  - Strategies to build local communities  
  - Tried-and-true events that help foster local communities  

An additional highlight includes the opportunity to participate in in-person mentoring groups. 

During the final week of the mentoring groups, we will host a virtual mentoring groups showcase. During this event, the community can hear about the projects on which the mentoring groups worked.

Lastly, both mentors and mentees will receive a certificate!
