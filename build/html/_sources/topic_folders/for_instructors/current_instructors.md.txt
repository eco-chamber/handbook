### For Current Carpentries Instructors

#### Professional development for Instructors 
As part of welcoming and orienting new Instructors to our community, and enriching and 
building skills and community among continuing Instructors, we have a number of ways to support you.

#### Community discussions
These hour-long sessions are organised by 
the [Instructor Development Committee](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/instructor_development/instructor_development_committee.html) and 
serve a number of purposes. Trainee Instructors use them as part of their checkout process. There they can raise questions about teaching workshops and other matters and get advice from more experienced Instructors. All sessions are run by volunteers. Instructors preparing to teach can attend to ask questions, get tips, and find useful examples or analogies they can use. Instructors who have recently taught can attend to debrief about what went well, and what might have gone better, so they can plan for next time. Sessions are coordinated through this [etherpad](https://pad.carpentries.org/community-discussions). 

#### Mentoring groups
Mentoring is a professional development opportunity that the Carpentries offers our growing Instructor pool to help 
community members learn and grow. Whether you are a new Instructor preparing to teach your first workshop, a seasoned Instructor 
hoping to run workshops in a new community, or an Instructor excited about getting involved with lesson development and maintenance, 
mentoring groups will help you gain the confidence, technical skills, and teaching skills you need to reach your goal. Mentoring 
groups run in specified rounds at regular intervals. See 
the [Mentoring Groups section](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/instructor_development/mentoring_groups.html) for more information. 

#### Carpentries Champions
If you are interested in building a local community, then consider joining 
the [Carpentries Champions](https://pad.carpentries.org/champions). Champions calls 
are run quarterly and you can hear from more experienced community members about what strategies 
you can try to build grassroots communities. There is already 
a [Carpentries Community Cookbook](https://cookbook.carpentries.org/), with 
‘recipes’ you can adapt for your local needs. There is a 
[Champions mailing list](https://carpentries.topicbox.com/groups/champions), and 
you can also join the `#champions` channel on [Slack](https://swc-slack-invite.herokuapp.com/).

#### Meetups page
If you are attending a conference or event and would like to network with other Carpentries community members, 
please add the details of the event and your own details to our [meetups etherpad](https://pad.carpentries.org/swc-events-meetup).

#### Mentoring and Development
The [Instructor Development Committee](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/instructor_development/instructor_development_committee.html) 
(formerly known as the Mentoring Subcommittee) manages the mentoring program, which supports Instructors as they progress 
through training, teaching, curriculum development, and other community-related activities.

#### Instructor Profile
We maintain a record of information for each of our instructors in our AMY database system. 
To keep your AMY profile up-to-date you can [login to AMY](https://amy.software-carpentry.org/) using your GitHub account. 
If you are unable to login to AMY, please submit your GitHub username to [team@carpentries.org](mailto:team@carpentries.org) 
and the administrative team will get your profile updated allowing you to login. 
We use instructor profiles to help us identify instructors for workshops and to keep track of when and where you teach workshops. 
We also ask for social profile information as well as your ORCID and personal website. All of this information will be published 
on the [instructor page](https://carpentries.org/instructors) of our website if you consent. Being included on our website is 
strictly opt-in. You must login to your instructor profile and check the box "consent to publish profile" or your instructor 
information **will not** be included in our listing.

Please see our [Teaching and Hosting](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/hosts_instructors/index.html) section for 
instructions on setting up and running workshops. This includes links to our checklists and describes the surveys we use to assess learners' and Instructors' experiences.

#### Other ways to contribute

There are many other ways you can contribute to the Carpentries beyond teaching workshops. These include helping 
keep lessons updated by becoming a maintainer; helping grow the Instructor pool by becoming a Trainer; 
contributing to email lists like Discuss or topic- or region-specific lists; serving on committees such as 
Instructor Development; serving on Task Forces such as CarpentryCon; helping translate our 
lessons into other languages; running a mentoring group; hosting discussion sessions - the list goes on. 
You can find a number of contacts for specific areas of work on our [Get Involved](https://carpentries.org/community/) page. 
Please [email us](mailto:team@carpentries.org) if you'd like to help but are not sure who to approach. 

#### Thank You to Instructors

We are very grateful to our community of Instructors! From those who teach once or twice a 
year to those who organise entire programs, from those who have just gotten involved to those who have 
deeply embedded themselves as mentors, discussion hosts, committee and Task Force members, and 
instructor Trainers: EVERY Instructor helps make the Carpentries what we are. Thank you!!
