### Carpentries Instructors

A Carpentries instructor is a person who has completed our two-day [instructor training course](http://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/), and who has also performed a number of follow-up tasks to complete the checkout process to become a certified (or ‘badged’) instructor. Our instructor training has the following overall goals:

- Introduce participants to evidence-based,teaching best practice.
- Teach participants how to create a positive environment for learners at workshops.
- Provide opportunities for participants to practise and build teaching skills.
- Help participants become integrated into the Carpentries community.
- Prepare participants to use these skills in teaching Carpentry workshops.

Our instructors are generally researchers themselves. In fact, many are people who have attended either a Software Carpentry or a Data Carpentry workshop, and who have been inspired to go on and train as instructors to share skills. [See a list of the instructors](https://carpentries.org/instructors/) who have currently consented to make their profiles public. 

### Motivation for people to train as instructors

People train as instructors for many reasons:

1. *To make their own lives better.* By teaching their fellow scientists how to build and share better software, our instructors are indirectly helping to create things that they themselves can use.

2. *Because it's fun.* It really is !

3. *To build a reputation.* Teaching a workshop is a great way for people to introduce themselves to places they would eventually like to work, and a great way to make contact with potential collaborators.

4. *To get practice teaching.* We are training more instructors every year, and giving them chances to teach online as well - both of which are useful for people with academic careers in mind.

5. *To help get people of diverse backgrounds into the pipeline.* Some of our instructors are involved in part because they want computational science to include a broader range of people.

6. *Teaching forces you to learn new things, or learn old things in more detail than you already know.* See this paper: [Graduate Students' Teaching Experiences Improve Their Methodological Research Skills](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/333/6045/1037)".

7. *To make the world a better place.* 

8. *To acquire useful skills for careers.* Instructors can expect to develop [this skill set](https://github.com/carpentries/commons/blob/master/text-for-instructors.md). You can re-use and re-purpose this wording for use in grant and job applications and for your CV.

### Becoming an Instructor

Anyone who supports the aims of The Carpentries is welcome to apply for instructor training. However, we do have capacity issues, which may limit whether we can offer you training in a timely manner or not. While we would like to help everyone, we do need to prioritise people at our member organisations, who have provided funding to us to ensure that they can develop instructor capacity in-house. 

Therefore, if you are at an institution that is not affiliated to The Carpentries, you may have to wait until such time as we can offer open trainings again. We have run a number of these, and hope to run more. When we do offer open instructor training events, we prioritise people who have some past involvement or affiliation with the Carpentries. Perhaps they have taken part in a workshop themselves, are planning to host a workshop, or have relevant prior experience. 

To request training as an instructor, please fill out this [form](https://amy.software-carpentry.org/forms/request_training/)

All new, open training events will be announced in our newsletter, [*Carpentry Clippings*](http://eepurl.com/cfODMH), or our [Twitter](https://twitter.com/thecarpentries) feed.

### Professional development for Instructors 

As part of welcoming and orienting new instructors to our community, we have a number of ways to support you.

#### Instructor discussions

These hour-long sessions are organised by the [Mentoring Committee](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/mentoring/mentoring-subcommittee.html) and serve a number of purposes. Trainee instructors use them as part of their checkout process. There they can raise questions about teaching workshops and other matters and get advice from more experienced instructors. All sessions are run by volunteers. New instructors preparing to teach for the first time can attend to ask questions, get tips, and find useful examples or analogies they can use. Instructors who have recently taught can attend to debrief about what went well, and what might have gone better, so they can plan for next time. Sessions are coordinated through this [etherpad](https://pad.carpentries.org/instructor-discussion). 


#### Mentoring groups

Mentoring is a professional development opportunity that the Carpentries offers our growing instructor pool to help community members learn and grow. Whether you are a new instructor preparing to teach your first workshop, a seasoned instructor hoping to run workshops in a new community, or an instructor excited about getting involved with lesson development and maintenance, mentoring groups will help you gain the confidence, technical skills, and teaching skills you need to reach your goal. Mentoring groups run in specified rounds at regular intervals. See the [Mentoring Groups section](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/mentoring/mentoring-groups.html) for more information. 

#### Carpentries Champions

If you are interested in building a local community, then consider joining the other [Carpentries Champions](https://pad.carpentries.org/champions). Champions calls are run quarterly and you can hear from more experienced community members about what strategies you can try to build grassroots communities. There is already a [Carpentries Community Cookbook](https://cookbook.carpentries.org/), with ‘recipes’ you can adapt for your local needs. There is a [Champions mailing list](https://carpentries.topicbox.com/groups/champions), and you can also join the `#champions` channel on [Slack](https://swc-slack-invite.herokuapp.com/).

#### Meetups page

If you are attending a conference or event and would like to network with other Carpentries community members, please add the details of the event and your own details to our [meetups etherpad](https://pad.carpentries.org/swc-events-meetup).

The [Mentoring Committee](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/mentoring/mentoring-subcommittee.html) manages the mentoring program, which supports instructors as they progress through training, teaching, curriculum development, and other community-related activities.


### Setting up a workshop

Please see our [Teaching and Hosting](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/hosts_instructors/index.html) section for instructions on setting up and running workshops. This includes links to our checklists and describes the surveys we use to assess learners' and instructors' experiences. Also check out our [Workshop Administration section](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/workshop_administration/index.html)

### Setting up a workshop website

For instructions on setting up a website for a workshop, please see the [workshop template home page](https://github.com/carpentries/workshop-template).
