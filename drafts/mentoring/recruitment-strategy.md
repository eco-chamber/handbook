## Mentoring Groups Recruitment Strategy

+ **Recruitment**
  + Mentoring groups are open to any individual who has completed [Carpentries instructor training](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/).
  + Community members who have taught fewer than two workshops (or no workshops at all yet) are invited as mentees.
  + Certified Carpentries instructors who have taught three or more workshops are invited to lead mentoring groups.
+ **Activities & Timing**
  + Mentoring groups run for between eight and 12 weeks.
  + Kari Jordan will hold a mentoring groups 'touch base with mentors' halfway through the 8-12 week period.
  + Mentors and mentees will be asked to complete a short [survey](https://goo.gl/forms/BOxgiKy99kVec07j2) halfway through the 8-12 week period.
  + The 8-12 week period will end with a virtual showcase.
  + Mentors and mentees will be asked to complete asecond short [survey](https://goo.gl/forms/I36OUFXGAofLps8E3) at the end of the mentoring group period.
+ **Exposure**
  + A mentoring page will be added to The Carpentries' [website](https://carpentries.org) with information on how to join a mentoring group.
  + Members will be added to groups, and new groups will be formed, on a rolling basis as needed, at the discretion of Kari Jordan.
  + The Mentoring Subcommittee will be instrumental in getting the word out about mentoring groups.
