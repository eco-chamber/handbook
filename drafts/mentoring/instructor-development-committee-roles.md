    - [ ] Add to the community calendar (see below)
    - [ ] Email Instructor Development Committee email list. 
        - [ ] Tweet about the meeting
        - [ ] Email individual people and encourage them to join
    - [ ] Create agenda for the meeting at least one week in advance on this [Etherpad](http://pad.software-carpentry.org/scf-mentoring) and solicit additions.  
        - [ ] Send an announcement to the committee at least one week in advance.  
        - [ ] Send another reminder for the meeting 1-2 days in advance.
    - [ ] Look at [last month's meeting's minutes](https://github.com/carpentries/mentoring/tree/master/minutes) to see if there's anything that you want to follow up with or continue. 
    - [ ] Email the following liaisons for updates to write at the top of the etherpad:
        - [ ] Executive Council: Raniere Silva
        - [ ] Trainers Committee: Erin Becker
        - [ ] Mentoring Groups: Kari L. Jordan 
- During the meeting
    - [ ] Sign on to meeting at appointed time.
    - [ ] Start the meeting with introductions.  Even if everyone knows each other, asking for everyone to say hi builds connection in the group. (Ask someone who will be brief to go first as a model.)  Possible questions include:  
        - Something you’re looking forward to soon
        - Something that’s happening in your area/location
        - What you were just working on before the meeting
        - Something you did in the past week that was fun / meaningful
    - [ ] If appropriate, generate + assign action items
- After the meeting
    - [ ] Secretary should [post the meeting minutes](https://github.com/carpentries/mentoring/tree/master/minutes).
    - [ ] Follow up with committee members regarding action items.  
    - [ ] Have a debriefing meeting with the other co-chair to delegate tasks moving forward and for next month's committee meeting. 
    - [ ] Click the star on the top right of the etherpad to archive a copy of the etherpad. The Secretary also does this, but it doesn’t hurt to do it twice!

##### Meeting Times

Typically, twice in one day (to accommodate time zones) on the third Monday of every month at the following times:  
- 13:00 UTC (Hosted by co-chair 1 or 2)
