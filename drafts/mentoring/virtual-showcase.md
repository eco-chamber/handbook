# Mentoring Groups Virtual Showcase

The Carpentries' community is invited to participate in a Virtual Showcase of our mentoring groups' projects.
  - __What to expect:__ Each group will present one slide outlining something they learned or completed with their mentoring group. We will also answer questions from the community and discuss the benefits of mentoring.
  - __Why attend:__ Be inspired by the projects of __your__ global community members! Be empowered to start a new project, contribute to a lesson, or prepare to teach a lesson. Explore the benefits of mentoring and being a part of a global community.
